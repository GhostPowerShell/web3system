| Consensus mechanism | Transactions are only updated when all verified users in the network agree to the condition of the transaction                                                   |     |
| Distributed ledger  | Transactions are appended in a distributed system on the network, which creates system recovery by eliminating a single point of failure or centralized entity   |     |
| Finality            | When a transaction is committed on a blockchain, it cannot be modified or reversed                                                                               |     |
| Immutability        | Records on the network cannot be modified or tampered with; thus, all information is secure and trusted;                                                         |     |
| Provenance          | The complete data or asset's history is available on the blockchain network                                                                                      |     |
| Smart Contract      | The codes are created on a blockchain network, and the computer and nodes execute on a triggered event. Hence, The codes are auto-executed within the time frame |     |
