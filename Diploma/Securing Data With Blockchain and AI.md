### Keynotes:

#### Blockchain:

1. PDC

#### AI:

1. Operation Support System (OSS) based on AI to enhance data management and security.
2. AI Secure Computing (ASC) is integrated into the OSS of every PDC.
3. PDC works as an AI operation platform, integrating individual AI components into a coherent, intelligent system of a broader nature.Different AI functionalities collaborate with each other in PDC and act as an intelligent system.
4. For secure computing, at the very beginning stage, ASC can integrate Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) module to generate more powerful and evolving security rules, and enable a secure and intelligent OSS for PDC
5. GANs are capable of learning the current security rules of a PDC and generating complex, evolving security rules. They can create malicious, yet seemingly legitimate, access requests to test and strengthen the PDCâ€™s OSS. This process is aimed at challenging the OSS's ability to distinguish between legal and illegal access requests, thereby improving its security capabilities
