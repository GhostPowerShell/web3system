Gas is the fuel that allows it ([[Ethereum]]) to operate, in the same way that car needs gasoline to run. 


`gas fees = gas spent * gas price`

- **Gas Spent** is the total amount of gas (in gas units) that was used to execute the transaction

- **Gas Price** is the amount of ether you're willing to pay per gas unit of execution.

**1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH**

**1 ETH = 10^9 Gwei**

So instead of saying your gas price is 0.000000001 ETH, you can say your gas price is 1 Gwei.

> Gwei stands for Giga-Wei, which is equal to 1,000,000,000 (10^9) wei. Wei is the smallest denomination of ETH. 1 ETH = 10^18 Wei.


**Gas Limit** refers to the maximum amount of gas (units) you're willing to use for the transaction. This is set by the user.
